Guard â€“ Intelligent Surveillance Robot

A Robotic Surveillance System for Autonomous Patrol, AI Monitoring, and Push-to-Talk Communication

Introduction

Guard is a robotic surveillance system designed to autonomously patrol predefined areas and provide real-time security monitoring. It follows user-defined patrol routines, streams live video feeds to a central dashboard, and offers AI-powered features such as:

Unauthorized person detection

Vehicle number plate recognition

Event logging

Emergency communication via Push-to-Talk (PTT)

Note: After cloning, the TVoIP folder must be moved to the same path as the guard folder (they must be siblings), as it is required for Push-to-Talk functionality.

Repository Overview

This repository contains the Guard Robot Dashboard source code. The dashboard runs on the robot itself, acting as a bridge between the robotâ€™s sensors/cameras and the central control dashboard used by security personnel.

Key Integrations:

Autonomous robot patrols for real-time area monitoring

AI-powered surveillance using YOLO, ArcFace, and EasyOCR

Emergency communication via TVoIP (Push-to-Talk)

Secure evidence collection with timestamped logs

Development Workflow

All new features are built in feature/* branches

Features are merged into the development branch

Stable releases are merged from development into main

Key Features

âœ… Autonomous Patrol & Live Monitoring
â€“ Robot follows predefined routes and streams live video feeds to the dashboard.

âœ… AI-Powered Surveillance
â€“ Detects unauthorized persons using YOLO + ArcFace
â€“ Recognizes vehicle license plates via EasyOCR

âœ… Push-to-Talk (PTT)
â€“ TVoIP-based emergency communication with security personnel

âœ… Evidence Collection & Logging
â€“ Records and timestamps detections
â€“ Supports search/playback of incident logs

âœ… Admin & Security Controls

Installation Guide
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/sakaristic/guard.git
cd guard

2. Move TVoIP Folder
mv guard/tvoip ../


This will make the project structure look like:

/home/sr06/guard
/home/sr06/tvoip

Backend Setup
3. Create Python Environment
python3 -m venv guard-env
source guard-env/bin/activate

4. Install Backend Dependencies
cd src/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt


If requirements.txt is missing, install manually:

pip install fastapi uvicorn pandas numpy opencv-python matplotlib
pip install torch torchvision ultralytics easyocr
pip install screen-brightness-control pyalsaaudio pydantic python-socketio python-multipart

5. Run Backend Server
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 5000

Frontend Setup
6. Prepare Frontend Environment
cd guard/src
npm install
npm install vite --save-dev

7. Install System Audio Dependencies (for TVoIP)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install pulseaudio alsa-utils sox -y

8. Start Frontend Development Server
npm run dev


Access frontend at: http://localhost:5173

Build & Package App (Optional)

To create the production build and package as an AppImage:

npm run package


After building, run:

./dist/Guard\ Controls-0.0.1.AppImage


You should see:

App is ready, starting backend...
